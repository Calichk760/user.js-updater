Updating the config manually is always a hassle.

<b>User.js Updater</b> saves you the trouble!

<b>Features</b> :
 - use predefined and custom user.js configurations
 - apply for any geckoview-based browser( e.g. Fennec, Firefox, IceCat)
 - set custom browser package name
 - optional: purge current configuration
 - firewall friendly: download with and without download manager
